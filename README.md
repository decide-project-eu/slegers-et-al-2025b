Exploring the relationship between first-week mortality and performance after the first week in broiler chickens

This repository includes the R script to run the following analyses:
•	Negative binomial mixed-effect model to analyze factors associated with first-week mortality (FWM)
•	Negative binomial mixed-effect model to analyze the association between FWM and later mortality
•	Linear mixed-effect models to analyze the association between FWM and either DG or FCR

These analyses were performed in Databricks, using R version 4.2.2. The following R packages are used: dplyr, ggplot2, lme4, lmerTest, lsmeans, glmmTMB
